# DRPPM-PATH-SURVEIOR-Suite

# Introduction

The integration of patient genome expression data, phenotype data, and clinical data can serve as an integral resource for patient prognosis. The DRPPM PATH SURVEIOR Suite: **Path**way level **Surv**ival **E**xam**i**nat**or** serves to do just that, by examining the interaction of gene or gene set pathway expression with cilinical data to discover prominent features that play a role in patient outcome. This utility is comprised of 3 R Shiny apps and a pipeline script which can be employed in a cohesive manor to provide an in-depth analysis towards underlying features affective survival. Through a systematic Cox proportional regression pipeline the expression of individual genes or gene set pathways is linked with a hazard ratio and p.values to determine signifigance and patient risk, which can be followed by interactive visualization in the suite of R Shiny applications.
